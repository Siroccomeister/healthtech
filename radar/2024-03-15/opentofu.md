[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) is an infrastructure as code tool that enables provisioning and managing infrastructure in any cloud. OpenTofu is a fork of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) that is open-source, community-driven, and managed by the Linux Foundation.

In the context of the CHT, OpenTofu is currently in trial for setting up Kubernetes clusters in Amazon EKS and managing user access in EKS and IAM in Medic-hosted configurations.
