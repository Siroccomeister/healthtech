[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes. It simplifies the deployment of applications into a Kubernetes cluster and provides additional features such as versioning and rollbacks.

Helm is used for managing CHT deployments within Kubernetes, which makes templating Kubernetes configuration files easy (also known as Helm charts).
