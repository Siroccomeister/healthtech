[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is an obsolete version of Angular, used in the CHT admin app. Deprecated: rewrite to Angular.

The CHT UI framework was upgraded from the deprecated AngularJS v1.6 to Angular in the 
[version 3.11](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/releases/3.11.0/). 
The upgrade drastically reduces the memory used on the phone. 
It makes development of the Core Framework easier and more reliable and also makes it easier to keep on the latest version of Angular which means we can keep up to date and on a supported version.
