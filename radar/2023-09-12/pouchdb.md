[PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.

PouchDB is used for storing data on the phone in the CHT webapp. 
It is also used as a library for querying CouchDB from api, sentinel, and the admin app.
