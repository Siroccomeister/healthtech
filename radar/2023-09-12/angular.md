[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework. 
It is used for building the CHT webapp.

Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

The CHT UI framework was upgraded from the deprecated AngularJS v1.6 to Angular in the 
[CHT version 3.11](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/core/releases/3.11.0/).
The upgrade drastically reduces the memory used on the phone.
It makes development of the Core Framework easier and more reliable and also makes it easier to keep on the latest version of Angular which means we can keep up to date and on a supported version.
