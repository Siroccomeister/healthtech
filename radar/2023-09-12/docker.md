[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is currently the most-used solution for creating and managing container-based infrastructures and deployments.

Docker is a platform to build container images, distribute them and run them as an isolated process (using Linux kernel cgroups, network namespaces and custom mounts).

It is used extensively for containerizing CHT products.
