[Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database. 
It uses multiple formats and protocols to store, transfer, and process its data. It uses JSON to store data, JavaScript as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API.

CouchDB is the primary database for the CHT. The CHT has a range of [CouchDB databases](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/database/) for storing different types of data.
