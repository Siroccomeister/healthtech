[Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. 

Currently deprecated in the context of the CHT. All the end-to-end tests were rewritten to WebDriverIO.

The primary motivation to migrate from Protractor to WebDriverIO is that the Angular team 
[announced in April, 2021](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/5502) that Protractor will no longer be supported.
