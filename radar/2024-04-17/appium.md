[Appium](https://appium.io) is a UI test framework designed to facilitate UI automation on many app platforms including mobile and browser.

In the CHT, we are [evaluating Appium](https://github.com/medic/wdio-appium-tests) as a tool that would allow for running some cht-core e2e tests against an actual Android device.

Some of the main advantages provided by Appium are:

- Tests can be written in JavaScript using WebdriverIO. This means that Appium tests would look and feel very similar to our existing cht-core e2e tests.
- Appium has a large thriving community and is well-documented.
