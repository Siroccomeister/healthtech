[Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/) static analysis supports development by providing feedback on code quality and security issues. Sonar analysis must pass on all new code.

[SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) is the cloud-based solution of Sonar. 
It can be enabled on any public GitHub repository in the Medic organization.

You can find more details about using Sonar with the CHT
[in the related documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/static-analysis/).
