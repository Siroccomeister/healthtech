[Sonar](https://www.sonarsource.com/) static analysis supports development by providing feedback on code quality and security issues. 

[SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) is the cloud-based solution of Sonar. 
It can be enabled on any public GitHub repository in the Medic organization and must pass on all new code.

You can find more details about using SonarCloud with the CHT
