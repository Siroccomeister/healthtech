[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), also known as k8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes has developed into the quasi-standard for container orchestration: Nearly every cloud provider provides managed Kubernetes, and even Docker Enterprise uses Kubernetes.
