<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> is an open-source Time Series Database (TSDB) that was developed explicitly to do detailed longitudinal monitoring. 
It also aggregates metrics and can automatically cull older data to save on CPU and disk space.

Compared to other monitoring systems it stands out in its simple, still powerful and fully code-based configuration and the equally powerful service discovery mechanism.

Prometheus integrates very well with <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> which is the tool of choice for dashboard visualization in the CHT Watchdog.

You can find more details about using Prometheus with the CHT Watchdog
