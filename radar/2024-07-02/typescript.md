[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language that gets transpiled to native JavaScript code.

It is currently used in the CHT webapp (since it is required for Angular) and in the new [shared-libs/cht-datasource library](https://github.com/medic/cht-core/tree/master/shared-libs/cht-datasource). There are ongoing discussions about expanding the usage of TypeScript to other parts of the codebase.
